# PlotMaster
Data Visualizer
SEM 6 Final project

A Basic Interactive Data Visualizer made in Python using Matplotlib and tkinter 
I was learning more about python and data Science caught my interest so i tried giving a gui to matplotlib instead of booting up jupyter lab everytime. 
this is more of a framework than an application. a framework in its early stages and it will be updated in the future.
more libraries will be made compatible as i learn them.

there are some gui elements that Don't respond very well and it will be resolved soon 

the GUi might look very stale and simple as i don't have much proficiency in GUI but i'm stil learning and will keep updating
